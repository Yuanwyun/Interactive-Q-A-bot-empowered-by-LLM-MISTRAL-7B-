# Interactive-Q-A-bot-empowered-by-LLM-MISTRAL-7B
• Develop a Q&amp;A bot to answer relevant questions based on different pdf inputs. The project uses the Mistral-7B model and the AutoModelForCausalLM pre-trained model.
• Set the suitable temperature, top-p, and Repetition_penalty values. Load tokenizer, configure parameters for quantization. 
• Build Dataloader, splitter, and create embeddings using the LangChain library. 
• Create a Retriever Chain. It utilizes an embedded vector database and a QA chain to retrieve similar vectors from the provided question and generate answers based on the database.
